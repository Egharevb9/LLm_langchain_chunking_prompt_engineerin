       "'85  Chapter 5: Storing and Modifying Information\\nDefining the\\xa0Essential Python Data\\xa0Types\\nEvery programming language defines variables that hold specific kinds of \\ninformation, and Python is no exception. The specific kind of variable is \\ncalled a data type.  Knowing the data type of a variable is important because it \\ntells you what kind of information you find inside. In addition, when you want \\nto store information in a variable, you need a variable of the correct data \\ntype to do it. Python doesn’t allow you to store text in a variable designed \\nto hold numeric information. Doing so would damage the text and cause \\nproblems with the application. You can generally classify Python data types \\nas numeric, string, and Boolean, although there really isn’t any limit on just \\nhow you can view them. The following sections describe each of the standard \\nPython data types within these classifications.\\nPutting information into\\xa0variables\\nTo place a value into any variable, you make an assignment using the assign -\\nment operator ( =). Chapter\\xa06 discusses the whole range of basic Python \\noperators in more detail, but you need to know how to use this particular \\noperator to some extent now. For example, to place the number 5 into a \\nvariable named myVar , you type myVar = 5  and press Enter at the Python \\nprompt. Even though Python doesn’t provide any additional information to \\nyou, you can always type the variable name and press Enter to see the value \\nit contains, as shown in Figure\\xa05-1.\\n Figure\\xa05-1: \\nUse the \\nassignment \\noperator to \\nplace infor \\xad\\nmation into \\na variable.\\n \\nUnderstanding the\\xa0numeric types\\nHumans tend to think about numbers in general terms.

      "As discussed in Chapter 5, all data on your computer is stored as 0s and 1s. \n",
      "The computer doesn’t understand the concept of letters, Boolean values, \n",
      "dates, times, or any other kind of information except numbers. In addition, \n",
      "a computer’s capability to work with numbers is both inflexible and rela -\n",

      "on Python to translate the concept of a string into a form the computer can \n",
      "understand. The storage containers that your application creates and uses in \n",
      "the form of variables tell Python how to treat the 0s and 1s that the computer \n",

      "the same as your view of data or the computer’s view of data — Python acts \n",
      "as an intermediary to make your applications functional.\n",
      " To manage data within an application, the application must control the way in \n",
      "which Python views the data. The use of operators, packaging methods such \n",
      "as functions, and the introduction of user input all help applications control \n",
      "data. All these techniques rely, in part, on making comparisons. Determining \n",

      "pared to some other state. If the variable contains the name John now, but you \n",

      "Making comparisons\n",
      "Python’s main method for making comparisons is through the use of opera -\n",
      "tors. In fact, operators play a major role in manipulating data as well. The \n",
      "upcoming “Working with Operators” section discusses how operators work \n",

      "behind operators is that they help applications perform various types of \n",
      "comparisons.\n",
      "In some cases, you use some fancy methods for performing comparisons in \n",
      "an application. For example, you can compare the output of two functions (as \n",

      "other structures that you create with Python. All this packaging is for your \n",
      "benefit, not the computer’s. However, computers do directly support the \n",
      "concept of operators. Most Python operators have a direct corollary with a \n",
      "command that the computer understands directly. For example, when you \n",

      "actually perform this computation directly, using an operator. (The upcoming \n",
      "section explains operators in detail.)\n",
      " Some comparisons ar en’t direct. Computers work only with numbers. So, \n",
      "when you ask Python to compare two strings, what Python actually does is \n",
      "compare the numeric value of each character in the string. For example, the \n",
      "letter A is actually the number 65 in the computer. A lowercase letter a has a \n",
      "different numeric value — 97. As a result, even though you might see ABC as \n",
      "being equal to abc, the computer doesn’t agree — it sees them as different \n",

      "Working with Operators\n",
      "Operators are the basis for both control and management of data within \n",

      "This fact demonstrated earlier in the chapter with the BasicException1.\n",

      "details into a log file in the application directory or a central location.\n",
      " Using a single except clause to handle multiple exceptions works only \n",
      "when a common source of action fulfills the needs of all the exception types. \n",

      "fit in the space provided).\n",

      "separator.\n",
      " ✓ .precision: Determines the number of characters after the decimal point.\n",
      " ✓ type: Specifies the output type, even if the input type doesn’t match. \n",

      " •\tString: Use an s or nothing at all to specify a string.\n",

      "are differences between a stack and a queue, but the main idea is to provide \n",
      "the means to manage data properly and make it easy to access when needed.\n",
      "Understanding Collections\n",
      "In Chapter 12, you’re introduced to sequences. A sequence is a succession \n",
      "of values that are bound together in a container. The simplest sequence is \n",
      "a string, which is a succession of characters. Next comes the list described \n",
      "in Chapter 12, which is a succession of objects. Even though a string and a \n",
      "list are both sequences, they have significant differences. For example, when \n",
      "working with a string, you set all the characters to lowercase — something \n",
      "\n",
      "Page 260:\n",
      "244 Part III: Performing Common Tasks \n",
      "you can’t do with a list. On the other hand, lists let you append new items, \n",
      "which is something a string doesn’t support. Collections are simply another \n",
      "kind of sequence, albeit a more complex sequence than you find in either a \n",
      "string or list.\n",
      " No matter which sequence you use, they all suppor t two functions: index() \n",
      "and count(). The index() function always returns the position of a speci -\n",
      "fied item in the sequence. For example, you can return the position of a char -\n",
      "acter in a string or the position of an object in a list. The count() function \n",
      "returns the number of times a specific item appears in the list. Again, the kind \n",
      "of specific item depends upon the kind of sequence.\n",
      "You can use collections to create database-like structures using Python. Each \n",
      "collection type has a different purpose, and you use the various types in \n",
      "specific ways. The important idea to remember is that collections are simply \n",
      "another kind of sequence. As with every other kind of sequence, collections \n",
      "always support the index() and count() functions as part of their base \n",
      "functionality.\n",
      "Python is designed to be extensible. However, it does rely on a base set of \n",
      "collections that you can use to create most application types. This chapter \n",
      "describes the most common collections:\n",
      " ✓ Tuple: A tuple is a collection used to create complex list-like sequences. \n",
      "An advantage of tuples is that you can nest the content of a tuple. This \n",
      "feature lets you create structures that can hold employee records or x-y \n",
      "coordinate pairs.\n",
      " ✓ Dictionary: As with the real dictionaries, you create key/value pairs \n",
      "when using the dictionary collection (think of a word and its associated \n",
      "definition). A dictionary provides incredibly fast search times and makes \n",
      "ordering data significantly easier.\n",
      " ✓ Stack: Most programming languages support stacks directly. However, \n",
      "Python doesn’t support the stack, although there’s a work-around for \n",
      "that. A stack is a first in/first out (FIFO) sequence. Think of a pile of \n",
      "pancakes: You can add new pancakes to the top and also take them off \n",
      "of the top. A stack is an important collection that you can simulate in \n",
      "Python using a list, which is precisely what this chapter does.\n",
      " ✓ queue: A queue is a last in/first out (LIFO) collection. You use it to track \n",
      "items that need to be processed in some way. Think of a queue as a \n",
      "line at the bank. You go into the line, wait your turn, and are eventually \n",
      "called to talk with a teller.\n",
      " ✓ deque: A double-ended queue (deque) is a queue-like structure that \n",
      "lets you add or remove items from either end, but not from the middle. \n",
      "You can use a deque as a queue or a stack or any other kind of collec-\n",
      "tion to which you’re adding and from which you’re removing items in \n",

      "Files typically have an extension associated with them that defines the file type. \n",

      "opening such files. In fact, you can likely choose from a number of applications \n",
      "to perform the task because the .txt file extension is relatively common.\n",
      "Internally, files structure the data in some specific manner to make it easy to \n",

      "me when no one else would.\n",
